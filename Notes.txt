Files: 

1. ansible.cfg: holds the configuration file for Ansible. [defaults]
declares the defaults for a given Ansible installation. In this case, we specify
the initial directory for the key-file and the inventory file.
2. inventory: a list of all the hosts that Ansible to keep track of


Ad-Hoc Commands:

ansible all -m apt -a update_cache=true --become --ask-become-pass
"Run this ansible command on all, with the apt module, (-a = argument flag) updating the cache for them all
and BECOME root (the equivalent of running sudo privileges) with the sudo password (-ask-become-pass)


Ansible ONLY UPDATES WHEN THERE ARE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE (ie: installing the same thing does nothing)
- you can also check the history.log files in the servers to see what it is that Ansible runs on each servers


Use "quotes" when you have more than 1 argument (ie: "argument1=a argument2=b argument3=c")

Playbooks:

Defines the state of an environment and the 'plays' (commands) required to get it to that point.

YAML Format: Inventory file begins with "---" on its own line
Statements begin with "-"

ie: "- hosts: all"

example playbook:

--- (starting character)

- hosts: all (run this on all hosts)
  become: true (as sudo)
  tasks: (gives the list of all our tasks)

    - name: Install Apache2 package (can be whatever we want)
      apt: (the module we are going to be running)
        name: apache2 (the arguments for that module- apt has a "name" argument, check ansible docs for this)
